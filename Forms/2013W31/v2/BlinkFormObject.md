# Forms v2

## BlinkFormObject 

Ordinarily, it is neither necessary nor recommended that this
constructor be called explicitly via custom code. It is documented here
to increase awareness of the APIs offered by its instances.

For brevity, this may be referred to as "BFO", and instances of BFO may
be referred to in our examples as "bfo".
