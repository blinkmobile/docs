# Forms v2

## BlinkFormSubFormElement

This constructor inherits from the
[BlinkFormElement](BlinkFormElement.md) constructor.

Ordinarily, it is neither necessary nor recommended that this
constructor be called explicitly via custom code. It is documented here
to increase awareness of the APIs offered by its instances.
