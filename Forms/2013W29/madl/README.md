# Blink Forms: MADL

By default, records captured via Blink Forms are stored in a MySQL DB. However, our platform allows you to configure your own procedures that should be run when a record is requested or received.

These custom procedures (a.k.a "custom code" or "Forms MADL") are designed to reuse your training with Interactions. Forms MADL is a super-set of Interaction MADL, that is: Forms MADL can do everything Interaction MADL can do and more.

This section documents the aspects of MADL that are unique to Forms MADL.
