# Mobility Platform: HTTP API: v1

Prefix all URLs with `https://SERVICE_HOST/_api/v1/`, where SERVICE_HOST is the
same as the one used when accessing the administration console or the end-user
interface.

This version of the API follows the [JSON-API](http://jsonapi.org/)
specification. This builds upon HTTP and REST conventions, and introduces
hypermedia and JSON conventions.
