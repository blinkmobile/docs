# Blink Mobile documentation

Documentation for stable and upcoming APIs. This repository is specifically for our closed-source projects. For our open-source work, the best source of technical documentation is often the repository itself.

Our open-source projects include:

- Blink Intelligent Client (BIC) [v2](https://github.com/blinkmobile/bic-v2) and [v3](https://github.com/blinkmobile/bic-v3)

- [BicyclePump.js](https://github.com/blinkmobile/bicyclepump.js)

You may also find our [snippets](https://github.com/blinkmobile/snippets) and [code examples](https://github.com/blinkmobile/examples) of use.

Also, see our [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/blinkmobile/docs/wiki) for more material.
